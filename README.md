# split60
The Split60 is Huskeyboard's first full keyboard, meaning that it uses a unique case. The cases are designed to be able to combine and look like a normal 60% keyboard, although a cable will still need to connect the two halves. It is a sandwich mount case; linear switches are recommended.

The Split60 uses the traditional ANSI 60% layout, except that the spacebar is divided into 2.25u/1.25u/2.75u segments to allow the keyboard to be split.

Eight m3x0.5 * 10mm screws will be required for assembly.

The two halves are connected by a USB C-to-C cable using an i2c connection.

The keyboard uses the ATmega32u4 chip.

The keyboard does not come with any LEDs.

The typing angle is 7 degrees.
